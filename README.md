### Podcasts&Blogs.pbix
This report visualises my personal spreadsheet data for podcasts and blogs I read.
I used the Gantt Chart visual to show how I started consuming them over time. There are so many entries that a user has to scroll down, and I'd like a way to visualise them all at once. 


### MyHealth.pbix
This report visualises my Fitbit data for sleep, weight, and activities.
I set targets within the visuals for each. Whenever I load in new data, I check if I'm meeting my targets.


### MyEntertainment_20170403.pbix
This report visualises my readings up to April 2017. I look at overall trends, where the books are set, and when they are published.


### MyEntertainment_20171023.pbix
This report looks at the proportions of media types over time, and compares the publication of books to when they were set.


### Things for me to try out
- Using a JSON theme file
- Using the buttons feature
- Using the field properties for documentation
- Split fields with multiple values into separate rows
- Plot clusters among variables
