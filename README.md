### Podcasts&Blogs.pbix
This report visualises my personal spreadsheet data for podcasts and blogs I read.
I used the Gantt Chart visual to show how I started consuming them over time. There are so many entries that a user has to scroll down, and I'd like a way to visualise them all at once. 


### MyHealth.pbix
This report visualises my Fitbit data for sleep, weight, and activities.
I set targets within the visuals for each. Whenever I load in new data, I check if I'm meeting my targets.


### Things to try out
- Using a JSON theme file
- Using the buttons feature
- Using the field properties for documentation
